Workflow Builder
A simple, interactive workflow builder that allows users to design, save, import, and export workflows using drag-and-drop functionality. The workflow is represented as a set of interconnected nodes, and the user can modify the structure of the workflow dynamically.

Features
Node Types: The application supports various types of nodes that can be dragged and dropped onto the canvas.
Canvas: A clean and interactive space where nodes are placed and connected to build the workflow.
Save Workflow: Save the current workflow locally as a JSON file.
Export Workflow: Export the workflow to a JSON file. An alert is shown if the workflow is empty.
Import Workflow: Import workflows from a valid JSON file and visualize them on the canvas.
Clear Canvas: Clear the entire workflow and start fresh.


Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Material-UI (for UI components), and custom styling
State Management: React state hooks (useState)
File Handling: HTML5 FileReader API for reading and importing JSON files
File Export: Blob API to export workflows as JSON files
